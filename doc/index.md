FIROS
=====

FIROS is a tool that helps connecting robots to the cloud. For this purpose it uses the [Robot Operating System (ROS)]( http://www.ros.org/) and the [FIWARE  Context Broker](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker) as a way to publish and listen robot's data.

FIROS works as a translator between the robotics field and the cloud world, transforming ROS messages into NGSIv2 Entities to publish them in the cloud, and vice versa.

This project is a fork from the **outdated** [Ikergunes FIROS package](https://github.com/Ikergune/firos). We have made a lot of changes - basically nothing is at it was.
